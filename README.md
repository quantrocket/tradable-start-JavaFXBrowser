tradable-start-JavaFX
=========================

This is a simple JavaFX browser project. You can use this as a starting point to integrate JavaFX in your app.
See the REAMDE included in the tradable project to see how to open the project in Eclipse.
Please note that to although JavaFX is included by default in the Java JDK 7u6 and above, in order to use the javaFX
library, you will need to make sure that jfxrt.jar is in your JRE System Library in Eclipse. If it is not, you should
be able to add it by:

 * Right-click-project -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path... -> click the Libraries tab 

 * In here, click add external JARs and add "jfxrt.jar". It should be in your Java install file under *.../java/jdk1.7.0_**/jre/lib*
